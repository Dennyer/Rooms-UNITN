Versione 1.2

If you have only one choice when you want to look for rooms now it doesn't show the choice menu, it selects the only choice automatically
The number of columns on the text that displays the rooms changed from 2 to 3 to improve UX on mobile

Version 1.1

I decided to reduce the message where the schedule for a certain room is presented so it doesn't take the whole screen.

Version 1.0

All basic function are there and the bot works.
