# Rooms-UNITN

The idea of this bot came from [LocusPocusBot](https://github.com/matteocontrini/locuspocusbot) and the features that it's missing.

## Feautres
So I decided to take it upon myself and implement features such as:

<ul>
  <li>Search rooms in every building</li>
  <li>Save favourites buildings</li>
  <li>See whole schedule in a room for a specific date</li>
</ul>

## Future
In the future I would like to implement the schedule for each course [like this](https://t.me/unitnEasyroomBot) but only time will tell if it will never happen.

## Prerequisites
In order to run the bot you just need:
<ul>
<li>MySQL server</li>
<li>Python 3</li>
</ul>

## How to run
First you need to rename the file "keys.cfg template" to "keys.cfg" and edit following the template.
Then you need to create the database (copy/paste the one in the repository) and install the requisites for python (requirements file in Source folder)
Now you can run the main.py (It should work)
